# Capstone Project : Gurudwara Time

## Overview

Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh ji  
[This is a Sikh greeting. It means: "Pure souls belong to God and Victory belongs to God" ]

This app automatically puts your phone in silent mode when you are at a Gurudwara!  
[Gurudwara is Sikh place of worship and also a community center]

No one likes ringing phones when you are singing God's praises.
It is disrespect to the Guru and to the sangat. 
So avoid embarrassment and make your phone sangat approved :)

Bonus: Quick navigation to nearby Gurudwaras.
Please Note: The silent mode will activate approximately 1 minute after you enter the Gurudwara.

This is submission project code which is part of [udacity android developer course](https://in.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).

__Technologies Used:__ Android SDK, GPS, Geofencing, Google Places API, SQLite, MVVM

## Why this Project?
### Stage 1
To become a proficient Android Developer, you need to design apps and make plans for how to implement them.
This will involve choices such as how you will store data, how you will display data to the user, and what functionality to include in the app.

### Stage 2
In this project, I demonstrated the skills that I learnt in my Nanodegree journey, 
and applied them to creating a unique app experience of my own. 
By the end of this project, I had an app that I could submit to the Google Play Store for distribution.

## What I learnt?

Through this project, I demonstrated the ability to communicate an app idea formally, using:
- An app description
- UI flow mocks
- A list of required tasks that I will complete to build the app, in order

This Capstone project gave me the experience I need to own the full development of an app. 
First stage replicated the design and planning experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.
Second stage showed how a properly planned idea can come to life using high quality code.
